- title: Open Education Platform
  problem:
    - online courses are not editable after they are created.
    - users can't create new versions of course / mix and match course material together
    - course format discourages users from moving through freely.  Course flow is lockstep.
  solution:
    - use git as a model for creating courses, closed and public
    - each course composed of small pieces that can be remixed
    - components are predefined or custom modules
